# Anchor Glow

respawn anchors glow with a cheap shader glow that gets brighter with every charge.

client side fabric mod for 1.21.11, 26.1 and 26.2. press **I** to open the settings (press it again to close, rebind it in Controls), or use Mod Menu. the settings menu needs [Wysss Library](https://github.com/realwysss/Wysss-Library) to open (fabric api and Wysss Library). color picker with hex field, a live preview, sliders and switches.

- **brighter with charge**: more glowstone charges, brighter glow
- **empty anchors**: also gives an anchor without a charge a faint glow
- **color**: any color
- **size**: how big the glow is (10% to 500%)
- **strength**: how bright it is (0% to 500%), above 100% it gets brighter than normal
- **softness**: wide and soft or small and tight
- **blend**: add (brighter, can burn out) or screen (gentler)
- **effect**: static, pulse, flicker, rainbow or shimmer, with a speed slider
- **range** and **max glows**: how far away and how many glows get drawn, lower is faster

## why it does not lag

- the whole glow is one draw call with one small shader. there are no extra screen copies, no blur passes and no extra textures
- nothing is drawn when there is nothing in range, and the mod does no work when it is switched off
- glows behind you, too far away or too small on the screen are skipped, and only the closest ones up to the max glows setting are kept
- the glow is hidden behind blocks by reading the depth of the scene, so walls block it

## how it works

respawn anchors are tracked per chunk when a chunk loads and when a block changes, so the game never scans the world for them each frame. a mixin at the end of the world rendering turns every glow into a camera facing soft disc, all discs are drawn together with additive (or screen) blending over the finished world, before your hand and the interface.
